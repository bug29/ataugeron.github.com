My name is Alexis Taugeron, and I'm a software engineer based in Angers, France.

{% img center /about/alexis.jpeg %}

In the past few years, I have built mobile applications on iOS (iPhone, iPad), and Flash-based social games on Facebook. I'm currently focusing on building a language-learning iOS game that I expect to release in Fall 2012.

I have great admiration for famous polymaths such as Leonardo da Vinci or Aristotle. I believe having a wide range of interests and skills is a great strength. As a developer, I handle work from frontend to backend, and my current goal is to broaden my skillset by learning more about design.

Aside from software engineering, I enjoy [traveling the world](http://www.couchsurfing.org/people/ataugeron/ "Check out my CouchSurfing profile!"), [taking pictures](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ataugeron "Check out my Flickr gallery!"), learning new languages (currently: [Chinese](http://iknow.jp/users/d1f00bdbe4f3fa23f6c449021a0555a8/ "Check out my study report on iKnow!")), sweating in saunas, exercising and chilling in coffee places.
