My name is Alexis Taugeron, and I'm a software engineer based in New York City.

{% img center /about/alexis.jpeg %}

I'm currently working on #1 music trivia game [SongPop](http://songpop.fm) with a great team at [FreshPlanet](http://freshplanet.com).

In the past, I have built mobile applications on iOS, and Flash-based social games on Facebook.

Aside from software engineering, I enjoy [traveling the world](http://www.couchsurfing.org/people/ataugeron/ "Check out my CouchSurfing profile!"), [taking pictures](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ataugeron "Check out my Flickr gallery!"), learning new languages (currently: Mandarin Chinese), sweating in saunas, exercising and chilling in coffee places.
